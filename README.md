# TwisterSpinner
a csharp command line program to act as the spinner in a game of Twister - so no one has to sit out

Peoples names and actions for them to perform are read aloud by the default text to speech synthesizer.

Pass the names of people playing as command line arguments. It's recommended you spell people's names 'phonetically' to help the synthesizer with pronunciation
